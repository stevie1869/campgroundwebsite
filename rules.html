          should be!</b></font>

      <font size="3" face="arial,helvetica"><b>1) <u>Housekeeping:</u>&nbsp;

        </b>Please keep your site and the campground clean by taking your trash to the dumpster as needed and not
        leaving it out overnight. The dumpster is open from 9am to dusk. Recycling bins are located through out the
        campground. Please do not burn trash or food in the fireplace- it attracts animals. Outside refrigerators and
        light strings are not permitted. Please do not feed the animals (ducks, geese, chipmunks, raccoons, etc.)
      </font>
    </p>

    <p align="left">
      <font size="3" face="arial,helvetica"><b>2) <u>Quiet Hours:</u></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;

        Our quiet hours are from 10 pm to 8 am. Please no loud music, radios or motorcycles. Fireworks and Fire Lanterns
        are <u>NOT</u> permitted. Check in time is 1 pm. Check out time is 11 am.</font>

    <p align="left">
      <font size="3" face="arial,helvetica"><b>4)&nbsp; <u>Pets:</u></b>&nbsp;

        Pets are welcome as long as they don't disturb others. Keep your pet on a <u>6 ft non-retractable leash</u> and
        clean up after it. Dogs must be walked by adults only and must have a current rabies shot. You will be billed
        for any damage your pet causes. Please do not leave any food out- it attracts rodents, skunks and even bears.
        Dogs that disturb others with continual barking will be asked to leave. <u>No more than one dog per site.</u> No
        guest pets. </font>
    </p>

    <p align="left">
      <font size="3" face="arial,helvetica"><b>5)&nbsp; <u>Children:</u></b>&nbsp;

        We love our children and want them to be safe. Parents must supervise their children at the beach, playfield and
        bathrooms at all times. Shoes/sandals should be worn in the bathrooms. Children must wear a life jacket on the
        boat and fishing docks.</font>
    </p>

    <p align="left">
      <font size="3" face="arial,helvetica"><b>6)&nbsp; <u>Wastewater:</u></b>&nbsp;

        State of New Hampshire regulations do not permit the discharge of wastewater on the ground. All sites have a
        sewer connection except for the Hilltop and Island sites. There is a dumping station next to the bathrooms.
      </font>
    </p>

    <p align="left">
      <font size="3" face="arial,helvetica"><b>7)&nbsp; <u>Swimming:</u></b>&nbsp; <u>THERE IS NO LIFEGAURD ON DUTY.</u>
        You use the beach and swimming area at your own risk. We assume no responsibility for accidents on the beach, in
        the water or at the playfield. Beach and playfield hours are from 9 am to dusk. <u> No unsupervised children on
          the beach, in the swimming area or at the playfield.</u> </font>
    </p>

    <p align="left">
      <font size="3" face="arial,helvetica"><b>8)&nbsp; <u> Boating:</u></b>&nbsp; Please observe safe boating
        practices. Boats must be registered and operated in accordance with NH State Law. Because of Milfoil, please
        clean you boat before launching.
        Boat launching restricted to registered campers.

      </font>

    <p align="left">
      <font size="3" face="arial,helvetica"><b>9)&nbsp; <u>Campfires:</u></b>&nbsp;

        Please keep campfires under 20 inches and in the fireplace. <u>DO NOT</u> move fireplaces. Please do not cut
        trees or vegetation. Do not cover with tarps. Always extinguish fires before retiring for the night or
        leaving-even for a short while. </font>

    <p align="left">
      <font size="3" face="arial,helvetica"><b>10)&nbsp; <u>Visitors:</u>

        overnight visitors. On 3 day holiday weekends, the guest limit is 4 per site. Please register visitors in
        advance. <u> NO GUEST PETS OR POWER BOATS.</u> Please do not feed the animals (ducks, geese, chipmunks, etc.)

          Smoking:</b>&nbsp; Please, <u>NO</u> smoking on the beach or restrooms. Smoking is not only unhealthy but
        objectionable to many campers. Please be sure all smoking materials are out and disposed of properly-not in the
        fireplace. </font>
